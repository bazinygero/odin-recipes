        <h3>Borscht is a sour soup common in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. In English, the word "borscht" is most often associated with the soup's variant of Ukrainian origin, made with red beetroots as one of the main ingredients, which give the dish its distinctive red color.</h3>
        <p>Borscht derives from an ancient soup originally cooked from pickled stems, leaves and umbels of common hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium), a herbaceous plant growing in damp meadows, which lent the dish its Slavic name.</p>
        <p>Its popularity has spread throughout Eastern Europe and the former Russian Empire, and to other continents. In North America, borscht is often linked with either Jews or Mennonites, the groups who first brought it there from Europe.</p>
